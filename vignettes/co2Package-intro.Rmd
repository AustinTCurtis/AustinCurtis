# Introduction

The `co2Package` is an R package that provides simple tools for loading, 
summarizing, and visualizing country-level annual CO2 emissions data. 
The dataset used in this package is based on the Our World in Data 
"Annual CO2 emissions per country" file. 

This vignette introduces the dataset, demonstrates the main functions, 
and briefly explains how defensive programming and debugging were used 
during development.

# Getting Started

To use the package after installation, load it as usual:

```r
library(co2Package)
